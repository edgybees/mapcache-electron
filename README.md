# About
MapCache Desktop is a desktop application running in Electron, built for Windows, Linux, and MacOS, providing the ability to create GeoPackages from geospatial data sources. Supported geospatial data formats include WMS, WFS, XYZ, GeoTIFF, KMZ/KML, GeoJSON, and SHP.

# Setting Up a Development Environment
These instructions were written for development on mac.

You need a basic understanding of the following tools that you should install via package manager (brew, apt, etc.):  
* git 2.25.0
* npm 6.14.4
* yarn 0.21.3
* node 12.16.3
* Xcode 11.3 or greater

# Building and Running MapCache Desktop
Once you have set up a development environment, these steps will let you build and run MapCache:
1. Download the code:  
`git clone https://github.com/ngageoint/mapcache-electron.git && cd mapcache-electron`
2. Install dependencies:  
`yarm`
3. Run:  
`yarn electron:serve` (run locally in development mode)

# Cleaning MapCache Desktop
The MapCache Desktop build and runtime processes will generate several files. The following commands will help cleanup your environment.
* Remove previously built resources:  
`rm -rf dist_electron`
* To remove the MapCache Desktop development runtime application data:  
`rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Electron`
* To remove the MapCache Desktop production runtime application data:  
`rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/MapCache`
* To remove all the client (javascript) dependencies installed by `npm run install` use:  
`rm -rf node_modules`

# Logging, Debugging, Building, and Testing

## Logging
The application uses https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-log for logging.

Log files can be found:
1. on Linux: ~/.config/MapCache/logs/{process type}.log
2. on macOS: ~/Library/Logs/MapCache/{process type}.log
3. on Windows: %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\{app name}\logs\{process type}.log

where `process type` can be one of `(renderer, main)`

## Debugging
The application is broken up into a main process and renderer processes inside of electron. 

The renderer processes can be debugged using the chrome developer tools.

# Building MapCache
The following will help you create binaries for windows, linux, and macOS. Due to native libraries within the application, each build must occur on its specific platform.  

1. Build Windows
`yarn electron:build-win`
2. Build Linux
`yarn electron:build-linux`
3. Build Mac
`yarn electron:build-mac`
4. Build All
`yarn electron:build`
4. The newly created installers are located in the build folder:  
`cd dist_electron`

# Limitations and Notes
It is worth noting that there are several libraries using native dependencies. The native depdencies are
1. better-sqlite3
2. node-gdal
3. canvas

Better-sqlite3 also has a dependency on the bindings library which currently has a bug preventing the loading on native libraries in electron 9. A pull request has been submitted but until bindings updates and better-sqlite3 updates to that version, `npm shrinkwrap` is used to inject a working version.


## Testing
Any changes made in development should be tested in the production version of the application for all supported platforms.
