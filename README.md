# About
MapCache Desktop is a desktop application running in Electron, built for Windows, Linux, and MacOS, providing the ability to create GeoPackages from geospatial data sources. Supported geospatial data formats include WMS, WFS, XYZ, GeoTIFF, KMZ/KML, GeoJSON, and SHP.

# Setting Up a Development Environment
These instructions were written for development on mac.

You need a basic understanding of the following tools that you should install via package manager (brew, apt, etc.):  
* git 2.25.0
* npm 5.6.0
* node 8.11.2
* Xcode 11.3 or greater

# Building and Running MapCache Desktop
Once you have set up a development environment, these steps will let you build and run MapCache:
1. Download the code:  
`git clone https://github.com/ngageoint/mapcache-electron.git && cd mapcache-electron`
2. Install dependencies:  
`npm run install`
3. Build:  
`npm run rebuild` (this will build gdal, canvas, and some other deps)
4. Run:  
`npm run dev` (run locally in development mode)

# Cleaning MapCache Desktop
The MapCache Desktop build and runtime processes will generate several files. The following commands will help cleanup your environment.
* Remove previously built resources:  
`npm run build:clean`
* To remove the MapCache Desktop development runtime application data:  
`rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Electron`
* To remove the MapCache Desktop production runtime application data:  
`rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/MapCache`
* To remove all the client (javascript) dependencies installed by `npm run install` use:  
`npm run cleanInstall`

# Debugging, Building, and Testing

## Debugging
The application is broken up into a main process and renderer processes inside of electron. 

The main process uses **port 5858** for debugging and you can use your IDE to connect.

The renderer processes can be debugged using the chrome developer tools.

# Building MapCache
The following will help you create binaries for windows, linux, and macOS. Due to native libraries within the application, each build must occur on its specific platform.  

1. Build Windows
`npm run build:windows`
2. Build Linux
`npm run build:linux`
3. Build Mac
`npm run build:mac`
4. The newly created installers are located in the build folder:  
`cd build`

## Testing
Any changes made in development should be tested in the production version of the application for all supported platforms.
